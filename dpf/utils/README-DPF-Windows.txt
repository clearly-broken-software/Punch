## Generic README for DISTRHO Plugins

This folder contains audio plugins downloaded from http://distrho.sourceforge.net/plugins

The included *.lv2 folder is an LV2 bundle and the *.dll file is a VST.
Check your host documentation to know where to place these files.
Note that most hosts support VST but not LV2.


If your host is not listing these plugins, make sure the binaries you downloaded match your host architecture.
32bit plugins go into 32bit hosts, same for 64bit.
Some hosts are able to load plugins with different architecture, but that's the exception rather than the rule.
